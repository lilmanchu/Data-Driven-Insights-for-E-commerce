# Data-Driven-Insights-for-E-commerce
Our research project aims to create a data-driven framework to help understand what determines E-Commerce sales and customer retention and what variables impact them most significantly. We will focus on analyzing several factors of E-Commerce, such as seasonal trends, historical sales, and user engagement data. We will focus on individual E-Commerce brands' overall sales, not singular products. With this information, we will create a linear regression model using R to predict sales and compare our results with other models to compare performance. With our results, we can then recommend strategies for optimal sales based on the predictions of our model and show the most impactful variables for customers. We will present our findings through an R Shiny interface that will let E-Commerce brands better understand what would be the most effective for certain brands to use to increase sales through different graphs. The goal is for our project to help E-commerce companies better understand their customer base, ultimately improving customer sales based on our findings.
